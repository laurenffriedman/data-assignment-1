<h1>New COVID Boosters Are Now Available. Most Americans Probably Won’t Get Them.</h1>
<h2>Given the slow rollout of the original boosters as well as only so-so uptake of annual flu shots, it’s likely that the new and improved boosters will never reach most people in the U.S.</h2>

<div class="intro">
<p>In December 2020, when vaccines to protect against COVID-19 were first authorized, so many people wanted them that it could take months to score an appointment. But by the time booster shots—designed to restore waning protection—debuted nearly a year later, fear about COVID had receded somewhat, breakthrough infections had become commonplace, and the vaccines seemed less miraculous than they once had.</p>

<p>Just this month, with the school year starting and the super-contagious omicron variant still spreading, health officials authorized a new and improved shot. This bivalent booster—so named because it was designed to target not only the original strain of the coronavirus but also omicron—is supposed to bolster our protection heading into the fall. It may also represent a last-ditch effort to get Americans boosted before an expected winter surge, as we enter a new era in which COVID shots <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/06/statement-by-president-biden-on-fda-and-cdc-authorizing-updated-covid-19-vaccines/">may be an annual affair</a>, like flu shots.</p>

<p>“There is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it,” said CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, M.D., M.P.H., in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0901-covid-19-booster.html">a statement</a>. But if our uptake of flu shots and the original COVID booster shots is any indication, there won’t be a line for the new boosters anytime soon. And the situation is far worse in many countries outside the U.S. Here’s where we stand.</p>

<p><span class="icon-intro">Original COVID Vaccines</span><br>April 2, 2021 was the day when Americans’ enthusiasm for the original COVID vaccines was most apparent—or when supply finally kept up with demand: We set a record, with more than <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends">4.5 million doses</a> administered in a single day. Today, about <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-additional-dose-totalpop">84 percent</a> of Americans 5 and up have received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, and 72 percent are fully vaccinated. Among Americans 65 and up, more than 90 percent are fully vaccinated. People in the U.S. who are unvaccinated appear unlikely to change their minds: 88 percent of them say they will "definitely not" get a COVID-19 vaccine, according to <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-september-2022/">a poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>.</p>

<p><span class="icon-intro">Booster Shots</span><br><a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-additional-dose-totalpop">Nearly half</a> of eligible Americans have received at least one booster dose of the COVID vaccine, and about a third of those 50 and older have received two booster shots. Unvaccinated people 50 and older were 14 times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to those who were vaccinated with at least two booster shots, according to <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status">an analysis</a> by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The vast majority of Americans have not gotten an updated booster shot, with just <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-additional-dose-totalpop">7.6 million</a> vaccinated with the bivalent booster as of October 3.</p>

<p><span class="icon-intro">Flu Shots</span><br>The CDC recommends annual flu shots for all Americans 6 months and up. Though the exact efficacy varies from year to year, the shots <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm">reduce the risk</a> people will get the flu, and make it much less severe if they do. But even though flu shots are nothing new and can keep <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm">tens of thousands of people</a> out of the hospital in a typical year, many people still do not routinely get them. During last year’s flu season, only <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/coverage-2021estimates.htm">about half</a> of Americans got a flu shot, a slight increase from the year before. As with COVID vaccines, older adults are much more likely to get a flu shot, with 75 percent of those 65 and up getting the jab, compared to 38 percent of those 18 to 49.</p>

<p><span class="icon-intro">Vaccine Inequity</span><br>While U.S. health officials are working hard to persuade Americans to get a third or in some cases fourth COVID shot, with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/covid-vaccine-doses-wasted-rcna31399">millions of expired doses</a> already thrown away before they could be used, billions of people around the world still have not received a single dose. More than half of the world’s population has been vaccinated against COVID-19, according to a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2202547">paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine</a> earlier this year. But those shots have not been distributed equitably, and in many countries, even healthcare workers and older adults remain unvaccinated. Some high income countries report vaccination rates greater than 90 percent, yet 20 countries have vaccinated <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#global-vaccinations">less than 15 percent of their citizens</a>. In Haiti, a 2 hour flight from the U.S, just 1 percent of the population is vaccinated against COVID. That’s all despite the fact that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01454-y">survey research has found</a> that people in low- and middle-income countries tend to be far more willing to get a COVID vaccine than people in the U.S. </p>
